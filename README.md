# Code Quiz

In this assignment, I was tasked with creating a quiz with some questions about JavaScript.

<h1>The following is the acceptance criteria for this assignment:</h1>

    * GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
    * WHEN I click the start button
    * THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
    * WHEN I answer a question
    * THEN I am presented with another question
    * WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    * THEN time is subtracted from the clock
    * WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    * THEN the game is over
    * WHEN the game is over
    * THEN I can save my initials and my score

<h1>What I Did</h1>

I created the html page to be plain and simple. I have the title of the code quiz at the top as "JavaScript Time Attack!!". It has the timer set over to the right hand side and a view highscore link over to the left. I have a quick description of what this page is about and the start button in the center.
